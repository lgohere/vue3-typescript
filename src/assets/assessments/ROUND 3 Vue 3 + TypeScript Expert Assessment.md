## **Answer Key**

1. **D** \- Date objects can be reactive but methods like `getTime()` might not trigger updates reliably. Use primitives or custom wrappers.

2. **A** \- Conditional types with extends work correctly in TypeScript for composable return types.

3. **D** \- For large arrays, `shallowReactive()` avoids deep proxy overhead while maintaining reactivity for array operations.

4. **C** \- Handle errors with separate error refs. Computed properties throwing errors can cause issues with reactivity.

5. **B** \- `unref()` safely unwraps refs and returns non-refs unchanged, avoiding the need to check if something is a ref.

6. **B** \- While technically possible to mix APIs, it's not recommended. Keep them separate for clarity and maintainability.

7. **D** \- Both approaches work: `reactive({...props.user})` for shallow copy or `ref(structuredClone(props.user))` for deep copy.

8. **A** \- Mapping to the specific properties you want to watch is most efficient, avoiding unnecessary deep watching.

9. **D** \- Both `customRef()` and computed with getter/setter work for transforming values with different use cases.

10. **D** \- WebSocket composables need connection state, send function, cleanup, and proper error handling.

11. **D** \- Both `defineModel()` (Vue 3.3+) and separating concerns provide good patterns for v-model components.

12. **C** \- `markRaw()` prevents an object from being made reactive in future `reactive()` calls.

13. **D** \- All approaches work: provide/inject with keys, singleton composables, or Symbol-based injection.

14. **B** \- Computed properties must be synchronous. Use separate composables or `watchEffect` for async operations.

15. **B** \- `triggerRef()` manually triggers reactivity even when the value hasn't changed, useful for forcing updates.

16. **A** \- Use mapped types to create type-safe slots based on generic constraints.

17. **D** \- Both mapped types and generic validation composables provide excellent type safety for forms.

18. **D** \- Both manual debounce logic and effect scopes work, with effect scopes providing better cleanup.

19. **D** \- All approaches (optional chaining, nullish coalescing, type guards) are correct for handling nullable props.

20. **D** \- Both generic middleware functions and typed registries provide good patterns for route guards.

21. **A** \- A single computed combining filter and sort is most efficient, avoiding intermediate arrays.

22. **D** \- Both `markRaw()` and `shallowReactive()` can help prevent issues with circular references.

23. **D** \- The plugin pattern plus module augmentation and registries create a robust typed plugin system.

24. **D** \- Different approaches work: Maps for dynamic keys, reactive objects for known operations, individual refs for simplicity.

25. **D** \- Both generic constraints with conditionals and factory functions with overloads provide type safety.

26. **D** \- All approaches work: manual cleanup, effect scopes for grouping, or returning cleanup functions.

27. **D** \- Both `VNode` and `JSX.Element` work depending on whether you're using JSX or render functions.

28. **D** \- Generic constraints, overloads, and registries all contribute to type-safe event systems.

29. **D** \- Virtual scrolling with large datasets requires shallow refs, memoization, and intersection observers.

30. **D** \- Discriminated unions, typed transitions, and computed state derivation all contribute to robust state machines.
