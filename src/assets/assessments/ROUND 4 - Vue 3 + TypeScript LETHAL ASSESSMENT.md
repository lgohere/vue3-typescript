# **30 Questions \- 25 Minutes \- COACH'S NIGHTMARE MODE ðŸ’€**

**WARNING: This quiz contains the most brutal, career-defining questions that will expose any weakness in your Vue 3 \+ TypeScript knowledge. Only the strongest survive.**

---

**Question 1** What is the EXACT behavior when you assign a new object to a `ref` that contains a reactive object?

user.value \= reactive({ name: 'Jane', age: 25 })

A) The old reactive object maintains its reactivity 

B) Both objects are reactive and tracked 

C) Only the new object maintains reactivity

const stateRefs \= toRefs(state)

A) `toRef` creates a single ref, `toRefs` creates multiple refs 

B) `toRef` maintains bidirectional reactivity, `toRefs` is read-only 

C) Both create refs that sync with the original reactive object 

D) `toRefs` is more performant for multiple properties

**Question 16** What happens when you use `markRaw()` on an object that's already part of a reactive structure?

const state \= reactive({

---

## **Answer Key \- LETHAL EDITION ðŸ’€**

1. **B** \- Both objects remain reactive. Vue maintains reactivity for both the old and new reactive objects.

2. **B** \- TypeScript generics are completely erased at runtime. No runtime type information exists.

3. **B** \- `shallowRef` avoids deep proxy creation, using significantly less memory for large nested structures.

4. **D** \- Without a default, the type is `User | undefined`. Always handle the undefined case.

5. **A** \- Execution order: `watchEffect` (immediate) â†’ `watch` â†’ `watchPostEffect` (post-render).

6. **B** \- Poor performance. The entire array is recalculated whenever `props.items` changes, even if individual items haven't changed.

7. **C** \- Template accesses all variables, parent only accesses `defineExpose` variables.

8. **B** \- Properties become reactive, but method calls are not tracked for reactivity.

9. **A** \- Conditional types resolve correctly at compile time when the condition is a literal.

10. **D** \- Missing error handling, not awaiting `response.json()`, and potential memory leak from unhandled promises.

11. **B** \- `triggerRef()` cannot be used on computed properties. Computed properties are read-only reactive values.

12. **A** \- TypeScript correctly infers the spread operation and additional `upper` property.

13. **B** \- Stopping parent scope automatically stops all nested child scopes.

14. **D** \- No `clearInterval` cleanup, unbounded array growth, and missing `onUnmounted` \- triple memory leak.

15. **C** \- Both create refs that maintain bidirectional sync with the original reactive object.

16. **A** \- `markRaw()` immediately prevents the object from being reactive, even if already in a reactive structure.

17. **C** \- Generic constraints are validated at compile-time, ensuring type safety.

18. **D** \- Race conditions with concurrent requests, no error handling, and no debouncing \- all critical issues.

19. **A** \- TypeScript strict mode catches potential undefined access at compile time.

20. **B** \- Deep reactivity proxy overhead for 10,000 objects with nested arrays is the primary bottleneck.

21. **C** \- `nextTick` runs in the current tick, `onMounted` runs after DOM is mounted.

22. **A** \- Each call creates a separate state instance. Need singleton pattern for true global state.

23. **A** \- `defineModel` returns `WritableComputedRef<T>` with getter/setter functionality.

24. **C** \- Error handling should be reactive and declarative, not imperative throwing in setup.

25. **B** \- Vue detects circular dependencies in computed properties and throws an error to prevent infinite loops.

26. **B** \- Old elements may not be cleaned up, potentially causing memory leaks in dynamic lists.

27. **A** \- This is the correct pattern for augmenting Vue's global properties with TypeScript.

28. **A** \- Async operations in setup continue after unmount unless manually cancelled.

29. **B** \- Generic information is erased; validator functions lose compile-time type information at runtime.

30. **C** \- This advanced pattern can be implemented using TypeScript's conditional types, mapped types, and proper generic constraints.
